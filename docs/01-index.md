# Gitlab Community Edition Operator

A juju operator charm for a Kubernetes deployment and operation of GitLab Community Edition.

## Description

GitLab is the de-facto open-source standard for a hosted Git repository manager, wiki, issue-tracking and continuous integration and deployment pipeline features.

This operator charm is using the official GitLab docker image (gitlab/gitlab-ce)
as a source for deployment. It is useful for developers who would like to quickly launch and test a Gitlab environment.

The default configuration used for this charm is providing the internal gitlab services based on the all-in-one gitlab-ce image.
